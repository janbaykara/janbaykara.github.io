#### **I'm Jan, a Product Design Engineer**

Right now I'm contracting with [futr.ai](https://futr.ai) to build out their team and kickstart product development in earnest. I also work part-time as the product lead for a non-profit, [Common Knowledge Co-operative](https://commonknowledge.coop), building tools and infrastructure for community activists.

In my spare time I study politics at [@SOAS](https://twitter.com/soas) University of London and occassionally visit / speak at at [@Nwspk House](https://twitter.com/nwspk).

#### **Right now**

* [futr.ai](https://futr.ai) is helping large organisations be more accessible for staff and customers, by deploying intelligent conversational bots to handle data, support services and infrastructure.
* [Common Knowledge Co-oop](https://commonknowledge.coop) is helping people into activism and maximising the impact of activist organisers, by designing open source tools and infrastructure and coordinating between international working groups.

#### **Recently**
* I worked as Head of Product Design at [gyana.co.uk](Gyana AI) to take their analysis consultancy to SaaS. They're helping analysts and property owners make sense of customer travel data, so they can make better business decisions.
* I helped *Explaain* to build and manage [GE2017.com](https://ge2017.com), the largest ever UK political advice quiz with over 2 million users.
* I was one of the initial engineers behind [Who Targets Me](https://whotargets.me/en/), working on a chrome extension and research project to highlight microtargeting in social media political advertising.
